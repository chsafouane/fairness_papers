## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository contains the list of papers related to fairness in ML that I've read over time. Each paper has an associated folder. These folders contain a couple of files each; an **annotated version of the paper** (by me😁) as well as **my notes**.

The notes PDFs can be handy in a couple of cases: 
- You've read the paper and you just would like to remember key ideas of the paper
- You haven't read the paper but you'd like to know what's the paper is really about (needless to say that the abstract might come handy if that's your goal😅)

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get started on fairness challenges in machine learning, these couple of talks might be really helpful (and they're really amazing👍!):
- [Tutorial: 21 fairness definitions and their politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIXIuYdnyyk)
- [The Emerging Theory of Algorithmic Fairness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-z84_nRQhw)
